hawk.eat()
# The hawk object calls the eat method from the Animal class. Output: This Mirzo is eating.
rabbit.sleep()
#The rabbit object calls the sleep method from the Animal class. Output: This Andre is sleeping.
fish.hunt()
#The fish object calls the hunt method from the Predator class. Output: This Anderson is hunting.

#Inheritance allows for code reuse and grouping similar behaviors of animals in one place.
